# Malaria-Land-Use-Model
files to simulate malaria population dynamics in a landscape subjected to in land and socio-economic changes
In this document we describe how to run a single simulation of the malaria land-use model described in Baeza etal.(in review) and the analyses for multiple simulations. The model considers the interactive dynamics of malaria and the human economy in a region that begins as an undeveloped state (AU). Development proceeds as the land is transformed at a daily rate (l) into a developed state (AD). Simultaneous to the transformation of the land, an epidemiological human-mosquito-malaria model and a macroeconomic model that mimics a labor-intensive productive system are also at play, acting in a dynamic and interconnected way. The model is written as a system of differential equations with three modules per region that recreate the processes described in the main text and supporting information. Figure 1 shows a diagram of the epidemiological model in each land-type U and D. The second part of the code provide the functions to analyze the model using same data as in the results of the main text, and generate new scenarios.
